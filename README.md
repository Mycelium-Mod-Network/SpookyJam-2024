Files for the SpookyJam 2024 modpack. This project uses the CurseForge export
format.

## About
SpookyJam is an annual mod jam held every October. During SpookyJam we 
encourage people to make new mods that fit with the themes of autumn, including
stuff that is spooky, mysterious, and fun. You can find more information about
the event [here](https://spooky-jam.com/events/2024/).

## Issues
If you are having an issue related to the modpack, please report it 
[here](https://github.com/Mycelium-Mod-Network/SpookyJam-2024/issues) and we 
will make sure the issue is properly reported to the mod developers. If you 
have a question or issue related to the event itself, please join our 
[Discord](https://discord.spooky-jam.com) to discuss the issue instead of using
